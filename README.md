# OpenGL-boilerplate
This is a OpenGL boilerplate for windows system that uses Mingw  

### For who it is meant
For complete begginers or those of you who don't want to spend rest of their lives working to setup the damn OPENGL environment for learning. Yes getting GLUT is easier but you do miss out on some more usefull tech and also this setup is used by most tutorials. Also glut does'nt give you recent bindings e.g glGenBuffer ya for that you need freeglut. Again it all boils down to getting a good binder "glew" and a window drawing library "glfw". And GLM does your math. You want to do it by yourself your are welcome to it. 

### How to use  
In order to compile simply copy the test in command.txt and paste it in terminal to compile. You can also study the directory structure to modify it.

### To-dos
Turn the text file into a make file
